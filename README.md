**SVM is a machine learning algorithm used for classification.**

*Working of SVM*
1. Takes labeled data and tries to separate it into two classes.
2. Draws a line that best divides the data points.
3. Maximizes the distance between the closest points and the line.
4. Adjusts weights when a point is misclassified.
5. Uses the final line to predict new data.
